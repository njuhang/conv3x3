# This file defines the project library dependencies, their paths, and indications to use
# pre-built or source versions.
#
# For each library dependency <LIB_NAME> listed in DEPENDENCIES, the user may define one of
# the two following variables to point to the location of the dependency library:
# * <LIB_NAME>_DIR, which instructs the build system to build it from source.
# * <LIB_NAME>_PREBUILT_DIR, which instructs the build system to directly use the binaries
# available in that library's /prebuilt folder.
#
# If these variables are not defined locally, a <LIB_NAME>_PREBUILT_DIR_DEFAULT or
# <LIB_NAME>_DIR_DEFAULT variable must be defined in default_deps.min instead to instruct
# the build system where to find the default location of the dependency library and whether
# to build it from source or use the provided binaries.

# Define prebuilt libraries delivered with the Hexagon SDK
include $(HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT)/build/default_deps.min

# Define variants supported by this project
SUPPORTED_VS = $(default_VS)

# Define paths to any dependency libraries not delivered with the SDK, and optionally override
# default paths and/or source/prebuilt selections for dependency libraries delivered with the SDK
# For example, the following would override the path defined for ATOMIC in default_deps.min, and
# build it from source at the below path.
# ATOMIC_DIR = $(HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT)/libs/atomic
# Or, the following line would override the path defined for ATOMIC in default_deps.min, and take
# it from the /prebuilt folder at the below path
# ATOMIC_PREBUILT_DIR = $(HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT)/libs/atomic
